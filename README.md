# Customer Support Robot Application
This example is part of the Lab 3 of the Course Intelligent Interactive Systems

## Description
When designing a human-agent interaction, we need to set some content, for instance, What do we want to communicate? What are the user needs? How could a social robot or virtual agent have an additional value? How do we like to share information with our users?

This case study is an example of learning and understanding the most general concepts when building Furhat skills. We will create an application where the virtual Furhat robot plays the role of a Customer Specialist. For this Lab, imagine you are the manager of a large Tech Company selling consumer electronics. The company has increased their sales in Sweden, so the number of customers is becoming more significant. Therefore, to relieve the workload of the Customer Support Team, you have decided to use a social robot at the main desk to handle the most straightforward cases. The robot must attend to the user's request, check order status, offer suitable solutions, etc. For the most simple version, the robot will interact with the user to solve a customer's problem with a wrong-delivered item. The robot can suggest different options for checking the order's status, generating new orders, deleting orders, offering additional services, and confirming the solution.

## Robotic Agent
We will use the Furhat Robot. For more documentation see [the docs](https://docs.furhat.io/skills/#the-contents-of-a-skill) for a breakdown of the content.

## Usage
Max number of users is set to: 2
Default interaction distance is set to: 1 meter
No other specific requirements.
